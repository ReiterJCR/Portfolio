                </h3>
                <p className="text-navy-300">
                  I first started coding in high school, fascinated by how a few lines of text could create something interactive. When I chose Computer Science at Appalachian State, it wasn't just because I enjoyed programming - I saw how computers could solve real-world problems in ways that excited me.
                </p>
                <p className="text-navy-300">
                  That practical problem-solving mindset still drives me today. Whether its building web applications or optimizing backend systems, I love seeing how code translates into tangible solutions.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-navy-300">
                    I believe that technology should be accessible and intuitive. My goal is to create software that not only meets the needs of users but also enhances their experience. I strive to write clean, maintainable code and to always be learning and adapting to new technologies.
                </p>
                <p className="text-navy-300">
                  I value collaboration and communication and enjoy working in teams where ideas can be shared and developed together. I believe that the best solutions can come from multiple diverse perspectives working together.
